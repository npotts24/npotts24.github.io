## About My Project



We are Project 7: Investigating the Impact of Air Pollution on Respiratory Diseases using AI/ML technology.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Collect data on Air Pollutants in Baltimore, Maryland
  - Create a Machine that helps us to predict air pollution levels in the future
  - Use Satellite data and ground-based data to track air pollution pattterns


Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the CEAMLS program.
