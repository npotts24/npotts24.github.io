On Monday July 29th 2024, we practiced presenting our Final Presentations. 
There was a fire drill, we had to leave the building and go outside for a while.

On Tuesday July 30th 2024, we had our Final Presentations in the auditorium inside the businness building. 
They provided us with free breakfast and dinner. The presentations went very well, in my opinion and I think every group did amazing.

On Wednesday July 31st 2024, we worked on anything we had left and still needed to turn in, such as the technical paper/report, the week 10 journal entry, our post-survey, and our final website.
