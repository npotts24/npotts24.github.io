On Monday June 24th, 2024, We used NASA GIOVANNI to get the coordinates of our respective regions of Baltimore, Maryland. My region was SouthEast Baltimore. I used a map I found online to distinguish between the high and low income areas of Baltimore. I chose 4 coordinates from high income areas and 4 from low income areas.


On Tuesday June 25th 2024, Dr. Damoah and Mr. Temidayo showed us a new way to plot our data. We chose the 4 areas surrounding Baltimore on all sides in order to get the coordinates of Baltimore, Maryland as a whole.


On Wednesday June 26th, 2024, We prepared our slides for the highschool students to come on Thursday, and we replotted our NASA GIOVANNI data.


On Thursday June 27th, 2024, We presented our slides to the highschool students that came to visit, then we prepared our powerpoint and video for our weekly report.


On Friday June 28th, 2024, We worked on our discussion posts and our weekly journal entries. We also had a writing session with Dr. Anita Pandey. We talked about the main focus of our research and the things we would be looking for in our research articles.
