On Monday, June 17th 2024, we met our highschool teachers, Mark and Dominique. We also showed them NASA Giovanni and continued to chart data to find PM2.5, SO2, NO2 in our respective coordiantes of Baltimore, Maryland. My coordiantes are in the Southeast of Baltimore. We are splitting it up into regions to test which areas, high income or low income would have more air pollution.

On Tuesday, June 18th 2024, we continued looking for data using NASA GIOVANNI. We searched for PM2.5, NO2, SO2, forr our assigned areas for 2008 - 2017. I had issues trying to get the Time Average Map to work. The map doesn't load properly.

On Wednesday, June 19th 2024, we were off work.

On Thursday, June 20th 2024, we went on a field trip to NASA. They told us about the things going on with NASA. They showed us how they were tracking the aerosols over time and how they affect our atmosphere and the Earth's temperature. They told us that they were pumping aerosols into the air inorder to combat the global warming. They also showed us their giant computer that has really loud fans because they work so hard. The fans are to keep the computers from overheating. 

On Friday, June 21st 2024, we had a writing session with Dr. Anita Pandey, we worked on our Weekly Blogs and our Weekly Project Video.
