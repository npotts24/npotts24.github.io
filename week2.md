On Monday, June 3rd 2024, in our lab, we did our aerosol presentations. The week before, Our project mentors told us to make a PowerPoint Presentation of our research on aerosols and what they are. We also talked about why we were in the CEAMLS program, why were in college, and what goals we may have in life.


On Tuesday, June 4th 2024, We worked on Python, the basics, and learned about the parts of a computer. We learned about RAM, RAM is random-access memory, which is like the short-term memory of a computer. Meanwhile disk is the long-term memory. When summoning variables in Python, the data is temporarily stored in the RAM of the computer. As long as the computer is on, all data in RAM is saved. We also started working on summoning the NumPy and MatPlot Libaries in Google Colab.



On Wednesday, June 5th 2024, we watched an MIT Python lecture which taught us more about strings, variables, and slicing into strings. We started working on a Literature Review for our topics: temporal patterns and seasonality; epidemiology, and spatial temporal dimension in relation to asthma cases, and pollution in the air that could negatively impact people's health.


On Thursday, June 6th, 2024, We continued working on Python: strings, variables, and lists


On Friday, June 7th, 2024, we also continued working on Python, we began to plot graphs using the MatPlot Library. we made scatter plots, bar graphs, line graphs, and histograms to represent the data set we were given.
