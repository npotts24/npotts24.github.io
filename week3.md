On Monday, June 10th, 2024, we went over our GitHub websites with Michael. Then we had a writing session with Dr.Anita Pandey. 
After lunch, we joined a NASA webinar where NASA scientists discussed aerosola in the atmosphere and how they affect us. We also learned about AOD, and AOD is Aerosol optical Depth. 
AOD is the quantity of light removed by a beam by scattering and absorption (LAADS DAAC). We also learned about dark target algorithms. Dark target algorithms rely on darkness. It uses infrared wave lengths and requires a clear sky and to be far away from sunlight in order to detect particles in the darkness.


On Tuesday, June 11th, we researched machine learning and machine learning types. Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that develops itself by using algorithms or patterns. (atacamp.com/blog/what-is-machine-learning) Some types of machine learning are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforced learning. Supervised machine learning is a type of learning where the model is trained using labeled data. These techniques inclue classification and regression. Unsupervised machine learning is where the model is trained using unlabeled data. These techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and association rule learning. Reinforced Machine Learning is is where a model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. These techniques include: agent, environment, state, action, and reward.



On Wednesday June 12th, we had a guest speaker come in from Google to tell us about her research project, where they are tryint to include African American vernacular English into speech recognition systems. 

On Thursday June 13th, we went on a Field Trip to The John Hopkins APL Research Lab. We got to see the robots they were working on, we saw some of the projects they were working on.

On Friday June 14th, we did a bit of Python, manipulating data using NumPy, MatPlotLib, and Pandas. We had a writing session with Anita Pandey and we talked about our literature reviews, how to collect research for the topica we needed, ansd the most efficient ways to do so. We also worked on our Week 3 project video and weekly blog.
