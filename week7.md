I flew the drone with my group member, Caison, and my Ph.D. mentor Dr. Richard Damoah. Dr.Damoah let me fly the drone by myself, I used the joy sticks to fly it upward, left and forward, and then finally, back down to the ground. The drone lands itself.

We did our Mid-Summer Presentations all day. I think my presentation could've gone a little better. I got really nervous and couldn't look up at the audience.

We worked on our goals and plans for the rest of the program, We visited a Recreation Center and spoke with some students, learned information from the BSEC from Johns Hopkins and We worked on python after lunch.
